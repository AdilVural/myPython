```{r, include = FALSE}
library("ggplot2")
library("knitr")
data("mtcars")
```

## Data

We use data on `r nrow(mtcars)` cars featured in the magazine *Motor Trend* 
in 1974.  This it what the data look like:
```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(head(mtcars, 5))
```

## Miles per gallon vs weight

Now we look at how fuel consumption is related to weight.
```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.align = "center"}
ggplot(mtcars, aes(x = wt, y = mpg, color = factor(cyl), size = qsec)) + 
  geom_point()
```
